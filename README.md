# MagicItemGen
A rewritten 5e item system to generate Path of Exile inspired Items.

Magic Example:

            Masterful Shortsword of Health
            
            Masterful: +1 to attack rolls
            of Health: While wielding this weapon, you may regain your hit die in health at the end of combat.


Rare Example:

            Rage Beak Shortsword
            
            Masterful: +1 to attack rolls
            Gleaming: You may add 1d4 Radiant damage to your attack roll once per turn.
            of Health: While wielding this weapon, you may regain your hit die in health at the end of combat.
            of  Rigamortis: On a natural roll of 15 or higher,  the attacked enemy has vulnerability to Necrotic Damage.

Currently working locally, with no Roll20 Macro Integration.
