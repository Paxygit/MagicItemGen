# MagicItemGen
Used with a rewritten 5e item system to generate Path of Exile inspired Items.

Example:

            Edged Shortsword of Health
            
            Edged: +1 to attack rolls
            Health: While wielding this weapon, you may regain your hit die in health at the end of combat.


Currently working locally for magic tier items, with no Roll20 Macro Integration.
