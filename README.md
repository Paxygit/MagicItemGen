This Project has concluded.

Undoubtedly more work could be done to improve the presentation of the program. Speed could also be improved by implementing our Google Sheet API into a Hard-Coded format, but that was not the Goal of utilizing the Google API. This was a fun project and a good introduction to Google API implementation, and has been great when used for my D&D sessions.
